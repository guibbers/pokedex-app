# Pokédex Application

Idea and execution made following this brilliant [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8&ab_channel=JustinKim) from the [Justin Kim YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEA2aEANvCH0evxQni-LIQg)

For this project I used the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) which is a public API about Pokémon!

## Click [here](https://guibbers.github.io/pokedex-app/) to access it!

## How to use:

Just click at any pokémon at the right-side screen and you'll have information about it at the main screen! The right side is limited to only 20 pokémons but you can always press "next" or "prev" to see the next or the previous list of 20 pokémons.

Enjoy!
